            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, and welcome; my name is Allan Bosire. <br>
                    <br>
                     I love <span class="all"><strong>all</strong></span> things tech, it is a passion that started with watching tech reviews on youtube and now I try to keep up to date with current and upcoming innovations.
                     I enjoy photography and love taking photos of the natural world. I also play a few games during my spare time and listen to music as often as possible. My top genres are 
                     Lo-Fi, R&B, Afrobeat, and Pop. <br>
                     <br>
                    I have a little experience with coding through taking some online classes. After finishing High School, I decided to take a gap year before joining university. I chose 
                    to join Moringa School to get an idea of what the software development field is like. I plan on taking software development in university so this was a good way for me to gauge what I could expect. <br>
                    <br>
                    I am pretty good with computers and I enjoy learning about how things work. I tend to pick things up quickly and I try to pick up new skills wherever I can.</p>
